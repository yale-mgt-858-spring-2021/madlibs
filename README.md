# Madlibs Activity
For this activity, you will use what you've learned about git to work collaboratively as a classroom to fill out a couple Madlibs stories.

## How To Setup This Activity

1) Join a breakout group. One person will work on the code and the others
   will help them not screw it up. ðŸ˜œ

2) Accept the Github Classroom invite from the class website (the meeting
   for today). One the one person
   who will be coding needs to do this. Its not a problem if you all do it.

3) The person coding should log into Repl.it to work on the assignment. Your
   repo will be automatically cloned.

5) Open the `index.html` file to see the app working on your computer.

5) Create new stories, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs! Or, just one of them---whatever you want. Checkout a new branch with a good name before you do your work. This will be a command like
    ```
    git checkout -b kyle-new-verbs
    ```
    Here, I named my branch "kyle-new-verbs". You should name yours something different, no spaces.

6) Take a look around at the files. Familiarize yourself where everything lives. 

7) Create a new file. You can also edit existing files, but that will make our merging harder! If you want to make a new file of verbs, you might make a file at
`/js/verbs/my-new-file.js` and in that file, add new verbs.

8) Check your code works. Refresh the page a few times.
   Did you break the app? No? Great!

9) Commit your changes and share them

    First, take a look at the status of your work

    ```
    git status
    ```

    It should show what files are new and what files are changed. Now, you want
    to add the new files, try the `git add` command. You'll need to supply a file name.

    Once you've added your changes to the "staging area", you want to make a commit. This
    is a command like

    ```
    git commit -m "Added some verbs for class"
    ```

    Now, push your changes up to GitHub.

    ```
    git push origin BRANCHNAME
    ```

    where `BRANCHNAME` is the name of your branch.

10) Go to GitHub, find your fork and the new branch, then make a pull request

    Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

    Click on the logo at right to get started.
    ![Starting the pull request](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-113/CPSC113-madlibs/blob/master/images/pull.png).
    Then, once you get to another page, click the blue link.
    ![Continuing the pull request](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-113/CPSC113-madlibs/blob/master/images/pull2.png)

    Finally, click the create button to checkout the commit.
    ![Finishing the pull request](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-113/CPSC113-madlibs/blob/master/images/pull3.png)

11) The instructor will merge in everybody's work.
